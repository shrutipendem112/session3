//	Asif has gone for a walk in the park. 
//	He makes rounds in the park multiple times and during each round, he collects some leaf samples. 
//	When he collects at least 30 new samples, he completes the round and returns home. 
//	Write a java program for this scenario, accepting user input for the number of leaf samples collected during each round. 
//	The program should display the total samples collected and the number of rounds around the park  that he took in collecting these samples.
